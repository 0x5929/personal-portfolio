## About

> Self-taught programmer with a strong technical background.

Upon graduating from UCI with an undergraduate degree in Aerospace Engineering, 
I discovered my most profound passion in computer programming. 
Since then, I have leveraged guides, tutorials, documentations, 
and open-source codebases to build interesting personal projects along with 
some more complex software solutions to overcome issues and challenges at my current workplace. 
With the tools and vast information available in today's world, I enjoy taking problem-solving to the next level. 
I would love the opportunity to work and collaborate with a team of like-minded individuals 
to learn, grow, and contribute to developing the next generation of applications.
